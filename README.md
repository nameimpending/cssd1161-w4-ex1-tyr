<h2>A github repository for Lab 4 (CSSD1161)</h2>
<h3>About Me</h3>
Hello! I am Tyr. I like to create art, music, and I have some prior experience with software development (but mostly at a small/personal scale).
<h3>Goals for this course</h3>
I would like to make a basic, functioning website (password manager) for this class. I also hope to improve my knowledge of team management skills/tools (such as GitHub itself.) I want to learn things that would allow me to adapt to an actual work environment.
