A github repository for Lab 4 (CSSD1161) \n
About Me \n
Hello! I am Tyr. I like to create art, music, and I have some prior experience with software development (but mostly at a small/personal scale).
Goals for this course \n
I would like to make a basic, functioning website (password manager) for this class. I also hope to improve my knowledge of team management skills/tools (such as GitHub itself.) \n
